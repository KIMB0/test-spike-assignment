# "Spike" assignment - test course

Author: Danny Nielsen.

This is my solution to the "Cucumber, Pairwise, Performance Technical Experiments ("spike")" assignment in the test course at CPHBusiness.

It contains a simple example on how Cucumber can be implemented with a dataset.

For generating pairwise test cases, I used [this tool](https://pairwise.teremokgames.com/). My pairwise results can be found in the [pairwise.xlsx]() file.
